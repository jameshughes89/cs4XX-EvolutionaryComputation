*********************************
Welcome to CSCI 340 --- Fall 2024
*********************************

Evolutionary computation is a family of powerful optimization algorithms often used to find solutions to computationally
intractable problems. The study of these algorithms and their application to problems is a large research area within
computer science. Course topics include combinatorial optimization, genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization,
search space analysis, multi-objective optimization, and neuroevolution. Research practices and technical writing will
be emphasized for course assignments/projects.
