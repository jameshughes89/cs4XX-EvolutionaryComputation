Base Task
=========

The base task is to implement a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for the
`Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem>`_.



Marking Details
===============

A total of 30 points may be obtained on this assignment. Although it is not required to complete all portions of the
assignment (one may choose to only try to obtain, for example, 20 points), all portions must be completed correctly and
effectively to receive all 30 points.

Below is a high-level overview of how points will be awarded. Details on each task are provided later in the assignment
description.

* A total of **5** points will be awarded for having a working implementation of the GA for TSP
* A working GA is required before completing any other tasks described within the assignment

    * A total of **5** additional points may be awarded for adding enhancements to the GA
    * Applying a GA to a more complex version of the problem, the *Vehicle Routing Problem*, will award **5** points
    * Generating an effective visualization for solutions may award up to **2** additional points

    * A complete report will award up to **5** points

        * Using LaTeX to generate the report will award an additional **2** points
        * Including proper references/citations awards an additional **2** points
        * Including figures and tables awards an additional **2** points
        * Performing an effective statistical analysis will award an additional **2** points
