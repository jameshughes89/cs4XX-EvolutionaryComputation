Overview
********

* Given a population of individuals within an environment with limited resources
* Competition for those resources occurs
* This competition causes natural selection
* This causes the overall fitness of the population to rise

    * An evolutionary "arms race"


* In the context of EAs

    * Given some problem and a mechanism for measuring solution quality

        * The problem is the environment


    * Generate a fixed size population of solutions to the problem

        * The fixed sized population is the limited resource


    * Apply the quality measure to the solutions
    * More fit solutions reproduce to fill the next generation's population

        * More fit individuals compete better

    High-level idea of most evolutionary computation algorithms.


* There are two big forces at play

    #. Variation

        * Genetic operators like mutation and crossover
        * Increases population diversity
        * Pushes the population towards novelty


    #. Selection

        * Surviving within the population
        * Decreases population diversity
        * Pushes the population towards quality
