Types of Evolutionary Algorithms
================================



Components
==========

* Evolutionary computation algorithms are remarkably modular so they can have as many components as desired
* The *core* components are discussed below at a high-level


Representation
--------------

* The representation is how the problem is encoded
* The **genotype** is the encoding
* The **phenotype** is what the encoding means in the context of the problem

    Visualization of the genotype and phenotype spaces. In this example, the phenotype space consists of integers while
    the genotype space encodes integers as unsigned binary numbers.


* Candidate solution, phenotype, and individual are words used to describe a possible solution to a problem
* Genotype and chromosome are words used to describe an encoding of a possible solution to a problem
* Locus, position, gene, and allele are words used to describe a part of the chromosome

    * Although, this jargon is not commonly used in practice
