Types of Evolutionary Algorithms
================================

* Given how flexible the framework of an EA is, there is a large and growing list of *types* of EAs
* Their differences often come down to specific details, their encodings, and types of problems they are used for
* Common popular EAs are

    * Genetic Algorithms

        * Typically have a string/array encoding


    * Evolutionary Strategies

        * Works well with real numbers


    * Differential Evolution

        * Works well with real numbers
        * Does not use a gradient/problem does not need to be differentiable


    * Particle Swarm Optimization

        * Works well with real numbers


    * Evolutionary Programming

        * Evolves finite state machines


    * Genetic Programming

        * Evolves *programs*
        * Typically encoded as a tree structure
