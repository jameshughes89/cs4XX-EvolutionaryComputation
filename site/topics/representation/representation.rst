Representation
**************

* The representation is how the problem is encoded
* How exactly a problem is encoded is one of the first things to consider when using evolutionary computation
* A problem can be encoded however one wants, but the choice can impact the quality of the evolutionary search

* There are many different types of encodings

    * Binary
    * Integer
    * Real value/floating point numbers
    * permutations
    * Tree structures
    * Finite state machines
    * ...


* Certain forms of evolutionary computation are designed to work with certain encodings
* However, given the nature of these algorithms, any encoding can be used as long as it produces the desired results
