* The maximization of the decimal integer value of an unsigned binary number was a *toy problem*

    * It is a trivial problem that, in practice, one would not use evolutionary computation for


* Evolutionary computation is typically used for problems with no known reasonable approach to address

    * It's a strategy to be used as a last resort
    * It is computationally expensive
    * It's often harder to understand compared to other algorithms
    * Depending on the problem, it is notorious for overwriting


* For learning purposes, classic toy problems will be used
* But it is important to know which types of problems they are appropriate for in practice
