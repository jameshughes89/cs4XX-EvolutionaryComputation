Genetic Programming
*******************

* Genetic programming is using a genetic algorithm for evolving programs/functions
* The genotype is typically a tree structure representing the program/function phenotype
* Genetic operators that work on the tree encoding are used

* Ultimately, it's a genetic algorithm that searches the space of programs/functions
