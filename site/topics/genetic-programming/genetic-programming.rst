Genetic Programming
*******************

* Genetic programming is using a genetic algorithm for evolving programs/functions
* The genotype is typically a tree structure representing the program/function phenotype
* Genetic operators that work on the tree encoding are used

* Ultimately, it's a genetic algorithm that searches the space of programs/functions



Example Problem --- Breast Cancer Identification
================================================

* Consider the problem of determining if an individual has breast cancer [#]_

* The goal is to build a classifier to determine if a patient has breast cancer based on the observations

* What should the classifier be?

    * ``If size > 4 and (shape == 3 or shape == 5) then malignant else benign``?
    * ``If thickness > 4 and thickness < 9 then malignant else benign``?
    * ``If mitosis == 1 then malignant else benign``?


* It would take careful study and a deep understanding of the problem to build a classifier manually
* However, AI and Machine Learning are often used to automate the process of building a classifier

    * The AI and Machine Learning would try to generalize trends that exists in the observations within the data


* Unfortunately, most evolutionary computation algorithms are not particularly designed to find models like this

    * Often they are used for combinatorial or real number optimization


* This is where genetic programming comes in

    * With the use of a clever representation, genetic programming optimizes programs/functions



Representation
==============


* S-expressions (symbolic expressions) are commonly used as the representation for genetic programming
* S-expressions are used to represent nested instructions and data

* These s-expressions are commonly visualized as tree structures


.. figure:: tree_examples.png
    :width: 500 px
    :align: center

    Three s-expressions shown as trees representing three different programs/functions. The left tree represents
    the s-expression ``((1.2 - x) * y)``, the centre tree represents ``((length < 5.2) or not(red))``, and the
    right tree represents ``if((open and right_closed)) then(forward) else(turn_right)``. The light coloured nodes
    represent operators while the darker nodes represent operands, both constants and variables.


* Consider the above program/function above for the breast cancer identification problem

    * ``If size > 4 and (shape == 3 or shape == 5) then malignant else benign``?


* If ``TRUE`` means malignant and ``FALSE`` benign, the program/function can be written as the following s-expression

    * ``((size > 4) and ((shape == 3) or (shape == 5)))``


* This s-expression can also be represented as the following tree

.. figure:: breast_cancer_tree.png
    :width: 500 px
    :align: center

    The program/function ``If size > 4 and (shape == 3 or shape == 5) then malignant else benign`` represented as a tree
    structure.
