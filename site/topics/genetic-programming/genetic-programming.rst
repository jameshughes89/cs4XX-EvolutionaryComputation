Example Problem --- Breast Cancer Identification
================================================

* Consider the problem of determining if an individual has breast cancer [#]_

* The goal is to build a classifier to determine if a patient has breast cancer based on the observations

* What should the classifier be?

    * ``If size > 4 and (shape == 3 or shape == 5) then malignant else benign``?
    * ``If thickness > 4 and thickness < 9 then malignant else benign``?
    * ``If mitosis == 1 then malignant else benign``?


* It would take careful study and a deep understanding of the problem to build a classifier manually
* However, AI and Machine Learning are often used to automate the process of building a classifier

    * The AI and Machine Learning would try to generalize trends that exists in the observations within the data


* Unfortunately, most evolutionary computation algorithms are not particularly designed to find models like this

    * Often they are used for combinatorial or real number optimization


* This is where genetic programming comes in

    * With the use of a clever representation, genetic programming optimizes programs/functions
