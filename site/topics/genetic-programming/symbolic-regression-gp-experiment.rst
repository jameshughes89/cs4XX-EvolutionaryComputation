**************************************
Experimenting with Symbolic Regression
**************************************

* The purpose of this topic is to

    * Gain more hands on experience working with a genetic programming
    * Think about multi-objective problems



Run on Multiple Instances
=========================

* `A total of 20 instances are made available on the GitHub repository <https://github.com/jameshughes89/cs4XX-EvolutionaryComputation/tree/main/resources/regression-data>`_
* All instances are made up of tabular data where the rows are observations and columns are the variables
* The dependant variable is always the last column
* Many of these instances are more than two or three dimensions, so visualizing and plotting the data may be difficult

* Each of these instances were generated by some function
* Further, normally distributed noise was added to each data point

* The goal is to find the function that was used to generate each instance



Language
========

* The language that is included in the provided code may not be sufficient to effectively model the data
* Try changing the language by adding or removing some operators
* Also consider adding floating point numbers as constants



Multi-Objective Problem
=======================



Comparing Results
=================



For Next Class
==============

* TBD
