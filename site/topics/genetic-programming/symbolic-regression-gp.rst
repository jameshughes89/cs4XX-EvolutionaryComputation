Symbolic Regression with Genetic Programming
********************************************

* The purpose of this topic is to perform symbolic regression with genetic programming
* The genetic programming system being used is DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python)
* Much of the heavy lifting required to implement a genetic programming algorithm is managed by DEAP
