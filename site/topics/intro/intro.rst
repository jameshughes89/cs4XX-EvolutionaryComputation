    High-level idea of most evolutionary computation algorithms.


* Nearly all forms of evolutionary computation follow the same idea

    * Initialize a *population* of *candidate solutions*

        * Evaluate the population's *fitness*
        * *Select* candidate solutions for the next *generation's* population
        * Apply *genetic operators* to the selected candidate solutions for variation
        * Repeat until some stopping criteria is met


    * Stop
