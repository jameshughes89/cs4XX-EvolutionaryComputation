**********************************
:math:`n` Queens Genetic Algorithm
**********************************

* The purpose of this topic is to emphasize the similarities between genetic algorithm implementations
* Although the first genetic algorithm implementation was solving a different problem, much of the algorithm is the same



Problem
=======

* The optimization version of the :math:`n` queens problem is going to be used

    * Given an :math:`n \times n` chess board
    * Place :math:`n` queens on the chess board
    * While minimizing the number of conflicting/attacking queens


* In other words, minimize the number of queens in the same row, column, or diagonal

    A configuration of :math:`10` queens on a :math:`10 \times 10` chess board with zero conflicts. This would be an
    optimal solution where :math:`n=10`.


* The reason the optimization version of the problem is being used is because it has a gradient for the search to follow
* The all or nothing (valid configuration or not) version of the problem has no gradient

* The phenotype space (problem space) includes all possible configurations of the :math:`n` queens on an :math:`n \times n` board

    * Assuming queens are not allowed on the same square, this is :math:`n \times n \choose n`


* However, as previously discussed, by using a permutation encoding, the genotype space (search space) is only :math:`n!`



Initialization
==============

* Before evolution can begin, an initial population of candidate solutions


Representation
--------------

* The permutation representation previously discussed will be used

    * A chromosome will be a list of length :math:`n`
    * Each of the :math:`n` indices correspond to each of the :math:`n` queens
    * Each index will be the queen's respective column in the chess board
    * The elements within the list will be a permutation of the integers between :math:`0` and :math:`n-1`
    * The value at each index will be the queen's respective row in the chess board


* Since the values and indices are unique, no two queens can be in the same row or column

* An example chromosome when :math:`n=8` is

    ``<0, 5, 7, 6, 3, 2, 1, 4>``


Population
----------

* A population is a list of chromosomes

    .. code-block:: text

        [<0, 5, 7, 6, 3, 2, 1, 4>,
         <4, 5, 2, 3, 6, 7, 1, 0>,
         <0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7>,
         ...
         ...
         <4, 3, 2, 7, 6, 1, 0, 5>]



* The chromosomes, and thus the population, will be randomly generated for this implementation of a genetic algorithm

.. literalinclude:: /../src/ga_n_queens.py
    :language: python
    :lineno-match:
    :start-after: # [begin-initialization]
    :end-before: # [end-initialization]


* The number of chromosomes within the population is defined by a hyperparameter called ``POPULATION_SIZE``
* The length of the chromosomes will match the number of queens, which is defined by the hyperparameter ``N_QUEENS``
* The chromosomes are permutations of the sequence of integers from :math:`0` to :math:`n-1`

* Note that ``sample`` is from Python's ``random`` library

    * `It returns a k length list of unique elements chosen from a population sequence <https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.sample>`_



Evaluation
==========

* The fitness function will count the number of conflicting queens
* Each pair of conflicting queens will only be counted once

* With the representation used, it's not possible for two queens to be in the same row or column
* Thus, only the diagonals need to be checked

.. literalinclude:: /../src/ga_n_queens.py
    :language: python
    :lineno-match:
    :pyobject: attacking_fitness


* For each queen, check the up and down diagonals to the right

    * There is no need to check to the left as any conflict to the left would already be counted


* The basic idea here is

    * Given a queen at index ``attacker_column`` with value ``attacker_row``
    * In order for a queen ``offset`` indices away with the value ``victim_row`` to be in the same diagonal
    * The value of ``victim_row`` **must** be equal to ``attacker_row - offset`` or ``attacker_row + offset``


.. figure:: 8_queens_conflicts.png
    :width: 250 px
    :align: center

    :math:`8 \times 8` chess board configuration with 4 conflicts. Only :math:`5` queens are shown here for
    demonstration purposes.


* Consider the above figure and the chromosome ``<?, 6, 3, 4, 0, ?, 1, ?>``

    * The question marks represent irrelevant values for this example


* When evaluating the queens from left to right

    * The queen at index ``1`` has a value of ``6`` and conflicts with two queens

        * It conflicts with the queen at index ``3``

            * The offset is ``2`` and the value at index ``1`` equals the value at index ``3`` minus the offset ``2``
            * ``6 - 2 == 4``


        * It also conflicts with the queen at index ``6``

            * The offset is ``5`` and the value at index ``6`` equals the value at index ``6`` minus the offset ``5``
            * ``6 - 5 == 1``


    * The queen at index ``2`` also has a conflict with the queen at index ``3``

        * The offset is ``1`` and the value at index ``2`` equals the vlaue at index ``3`` plus the offset ``1``
        * ``3 + 1 == 4``


    * Lastly, the queen at index ``3`` conflicts with the queen at index ``6``

        * ``4  - 3 == 1``


    * As mentioned above, there is no need to look to the left of any queen as those conflicts would already be counted

        * For example, the queen at index ``6``\s conflicts were already counted



* With this fitness function, the fitness of each candidate solution within the population can be calculated and stored
