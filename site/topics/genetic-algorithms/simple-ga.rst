********************************
Implementing a Genetic Algorithm
********************************

* Purpose is to see one


Problem
=======


Initialization
==============
* How do we start the problem?
   * Initialize population
   * ... and other parameters


Evaluation
==========
* What is a ``good'' solution
* How to weed out ``good'' from ``less-good''


Selection
=========
* How do we pick solutions to persist?


Variation Operators
===================
* Only having population of the same solutions is boring
* How to make different solutions
   * More fun?
   * Better ones?
   * Maybe both!!


Termination Requirement
=======================
* Don't have infinite resources to run EC forever
* Have to end loop somehow...


For Next Class
==============

* TBD

    * TBD
