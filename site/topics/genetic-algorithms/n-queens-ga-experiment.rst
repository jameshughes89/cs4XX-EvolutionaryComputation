*********************************************************
Experimenting with the :math:`n` Queens Genetic Algorithm
*********************************************************

* It is time to tinker with the provided :math:`n` queens genetic algorithm implementation
* The purpose of this is to

    * Gain more hands on experience working with a genetic algorithm
    * Implement different operators and see the impact of the changes
    * Implement a different representation to see how it impacts results
    * See how to start comparing results
