Run Multiple Times and Plot
===========================

#. If not done already, download the

    * :download:`Selection Script </../src/selection.py>`
    * :download:`Crossover Script </../src/crossover.py>`
    * :download:`Mutation Script </../src/mutation.py>`
    * :download:`n Queens GA </../src/ga_n_queens.py>`


#. Get the :math:`n` queens genetic algorithm running

    * Play around with the hyperparameters
    * Try to make the problem more difficult by increasing the value of :math:`n`


#. Create a learning curve plot

    * See the bitstring genetic algorithm for an example of how this was done

        Learning curve for some run of the :math:`n` queens genetic algorithm. This plot is for a run where
        :math:`n=14`, the population size was 100, and the number of generations was 500. Since this is a minimization
        problem, lower fitness values are better.
