Implementing PSO
****************

* The purpose of this topic is to see an implementation of particle swarm optimization (PSO)
* It is a simple implementation that incorporates no enhancements
* The problem PSO is being applied to in this example is some arbitrary benchmark real number optimization problem
* Despite how simple the implementation is, it will still perform well



Problem
=======

* PSO is often used for real/floating point number optimization
* Any real number optimization problem would work, but there there exist several benchmark test functions

    * `Wikipedia has a list of popular test functions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_functions_for_optimization>`_


* The goal is

    * Given some :math:`n` dimensional real/floating point number function

        * The function takes :math:`n` real/floating point numbers as arguments
        * The function returns a single real/floating point number


    * Find the arguments for the function that produces the smallest/largest output

        * Depending on if it is a minimization or maximization problem
