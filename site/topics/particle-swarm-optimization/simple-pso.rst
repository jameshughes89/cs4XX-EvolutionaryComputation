Implementing PSO
****************

* The purpose of this topic is to see an implementation of particle swarm optimization (PSO)
* It is a simple implementation that incorporates no enhancements
* The problem PSO is being applied to in this example is some arbitrary benchmark real number optimization problem
* Despite how simple the implementation is, it will still perform well
