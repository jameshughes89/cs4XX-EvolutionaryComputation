Particle Swarm Optimization
***************************

* Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a stochastic population based optimization technique

    * Like many forms of evolutionary computation


* It consists of *particles* that all act independently, but are influenced by the population

    A flock of birds. Each bird is making decisions independently that are informed by other birds around them. As a
    result, it appears as if the flock is moving in some well coordinated way.
