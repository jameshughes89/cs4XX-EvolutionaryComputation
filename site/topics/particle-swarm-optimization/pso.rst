Particle Swarm Optimization
***************************

* Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a stochastic population based optimization technique

    * Like many forms of evolutionary computation


* It consists of *particles* that all act independently, but are influenced by the population

    A flock of birds. Each bird is making decisions independently that are informed by other birds around them. As a
    result, it appears as if the flock is moving in some well coordinated way.



Particles
=========

* PSO consists of a population of *particles* that represent points in some search space

    * Like candidate solutions from a genetic algorithm


* Unlike chromosomes, these particles do not have the traditional variation operators of mutation and crossover
* Instead, the particles have a propensity to more towards areas that the particles *likes*
* However, these particles are also influenced by the population of particles

    * They also have a propensity to move towards areas that the population *likes*


* In terms of an optimization problem

    * Each particle has a propensity to move towards the best area of the search space it has encountered
    * While also having a propensity to move to the best part of the search space the population has encountered
