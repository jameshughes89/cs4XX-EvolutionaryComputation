Selection and Population Management
***********************************


Generational vs. Steady State
=============================

* All the algorithms provided so far have been implemented as a generational algorithm

    * A whole new population is created based on the current population
    * The new population becomes the current population
    * The population size remains the same


* With the generational algorith, depending on how the genetic operators are applied, the new population is filled with

    * Copies of unchanged selected chromosomes
    * Mutated selected chromosomes
    * Offspring resulting from crossover on selected chromosomes
