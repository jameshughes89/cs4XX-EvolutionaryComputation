***********************************
Selection and Population Management
***********************************

* One of the main driving forces of evolutionary computation algorithms is the variation operators
* Another major driving force is the selection strategy

    * This determines an individual's ability to survive and have offspring based on their fitness values


* Selection is based on the *relative* fitness values of the individual
* It works independently from the actual problem and representation
