Selection and Population Management
***********************************

* One of the main driving forces of evolutionary computation algorithms is the variation operators
* Another major driving force is the selection strategy

    * This determines an individual's ability to survive and have offspring based on their fitness values



Generational vs. Steady State
=============================

* All the algorithms provided so far have been implemented as a generational algorithm

    * A whole new population is created based on the current population
    * The new population becomes the current population
    * The population size remains the same
    * There are very discrete transitions between generations


* With the generational algorithm, depending on how the genetic operators are applied, the new population is filled with

    * Copies of unchanged selected chromosomes
    * Mutated selected chromosomes
    * Offspring resulting from crossover on selected chromosomes


* On the other hand, steady state algorithms provide a more continuous type of evolution

    * Not as clear discrete transitions between generations


* With steady state

    * Given a single population of size :math:`\mu`
    * Select some number of chromosomes :math:`\lambda` and apply the variation operators to produce the offspring
    * Replace :math:`\lambda` chromosomes in the population with the offspring


* The *generational gap* is the proportion of the the population that was replaced

    * :math:`\frac{\lambda}{\mu}`


* If the number of chromosomes selected is equal to the population size, it is equivalent to a generational algorithm

    * If :math:`\lambda = \mu`
    * When the generational gap is :math:`\frac{\lambda}{\mu} = 1`


* With a generational algorithm, the whole population is replaced
* But with a generational gap less than one, there needs to be another selection mechanism for replacement

    * Determining which candidate solutions of the population are to be replaced with the :math:`\lambda` offspring
