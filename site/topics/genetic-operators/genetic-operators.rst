Genetic Operators
*****************

* Below is a collection of common genetic operators for broad types of representations

    * This is by no means exhaustive
    * Further, it should not be assumed that they are particularly effective
    * They are intended to provide foundational ideas 


* These operators focus on representations for genetic algorithms

    * The motivation for focusing on genetic algorithms is they are quite a general form of evolutionary computation


* Although common genetic operators are presented, being creative and trying to invent new operators is encouraged
