Tuning Hyperparameters
**********************

* All the evolutionary computation algorithms used require some form of hyperparameter tuning
* Further, given the modular nature of these algorithms, each part of the algorithm is itself a hyperparameter

    * These may also come with additional hypermarkets that require some tuning


* There exists no best way to perform parameter tuning, but there are some common strategies
