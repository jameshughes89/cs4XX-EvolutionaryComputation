What Comparing Distributions *Means*

Random Variables
================


Example --- Drug Trial
======================

* Consider a drug trial
* A group of 50 people is given a new drug that is intended to reduce the recovery time of the flu
* Another group is given a placebo
* No one in either group knows if they are given the new drug or the placebo

* Here, the random variables are the two groups and the observations are the recovery times of the people in each group

    Distributions of group recovery times for individuals in the placebo group and drug group.


* With the above example

    * The average recovery time for the placebo group was roughly 15.4 days
    * The average recovery time for the drug group was roughly 13.8 days
    * The drug group recovered, on average, 1.6 faster


* One may be tempted to conclude that the drug clearly works
* However, the average recovery time is a summary statistic of a distribution
* When observing the distributions, it is clear that there is more nuance

* Additionally, there were only 50 observations fro each group
* Every individual is different and every observation is different
* If I were to do this again, the distributions would look different
* What are the odds that this result just happened by chance?
