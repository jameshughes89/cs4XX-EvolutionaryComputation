.. warning::

    Claiming that objectives/tasks/enhancements were complete within the report when in reality they were not is (a) a
    serious form of academic misconduct --- falsifying results --- and (b) against the student code of conduct.

    These violations are subject to severe penalty. All violations will be reported and investigated fully.



Base Task
=========

* Select a topic for a project
* Implement the project idea
* Give a presentation
* Submit code before presentation
* Submit the final implementation



Marking Details
===============

A total of 30 points may be obtained for the project. Although it is not required to complete all portions of the
project (one may choose to only try to obtain, for example, 20 points), all portions must be completed correctly and
effectively to receive all 30 points.

Below is a high-level overview of how points will be awarded. Details on each task are provided later in the assignment
description.

* A total of **5** points may be awarded for having a working implementation of the project topic

* A total of **25** will be awarded for the project presentation



Project Topics
==============

It is the students' responsibility to select a project topic and have it approved by the instructor. Once approved, the
project direction is up to the students. Students are encouraged to be creative and ambitious. Further, marks will not
be lost due to the quality of the final results.

Most project ideas usually fall under one of the following categories:

    * Application --- Apply an algorithm to a particular problem of interest
    * Enhancements/Modifications --- Implement a novel idea into an algorithm and analyze results
    * New Algorithm --- Create a new algorithm tha follows the high-level idea of evolutionary computation


Do not be afraid to try something different. The instructor values creativity will make every attempt to be as accepting
of project ideas as possible.

Topics will be selected on a first-come first-served basis, however, if multiple individuals want to do the same
project, the instructor will work the the individual to direct them such that the details differ between individuals.

All topic choices, along with preferred presentation date (if choosing to give a presentation) are to be submitted to
the instructor via email and approved before the approval date.


Implementation Marks
--------------------

How the points for the implementation will be awarded will depend heavily on the specific project. Thus it is difficult
to be specific about how exactly the points will be awarded. As a starting place, consider that the points will be
awarded for a combination of modifications, enhancements, novelty, analysis, interesting-ness, etc.

Like with most aspects of the course, the instructor and marker will be looking for excuses to award points to students
for their work. In other words, be creative, emphasize what is felt to be worth points, and make clear *why* it is felt
that what was done is worth the points.



Project Presentation
=====================

Project Presentation
--------------------

Presentations should be 40 minutes with 10 minutes for questions. The presentations will follow the same general format
as a report (intro, literature review, problem description, enhancements, notable ideas and creativity, etc.).


Presentation Dates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It may be the case that it is natural for some topics to come before others, but in general, the date will be selected
on a first-come first-served basis. Anyone unable to select a date will be assigned one by the instructor.

All project topic choices along with preferred presentation dates, if applicable, are to be submitted to the instructor
via email.

Presentation Dates:

* Monday Nov 3: Available
* Wednesday Nov 5: Available
* Friday Nov 7: Available
* Monday Nov 17: Available
* Wednesday Nov 19: Available
* Friday Nov 21: Available
* Monday Nov Nov 24: Available
* Wednesday Nov 26: Available
* Friday Nov 28: Available
* Monday Dec 1: Available


Points
^^^^^^

A total of 25 points may be obtained from the project presentation and the ability to answer questions about the
project during the question period. As every project is different, it is difficult to create a concrete set of points,
thus the marks will be determined by the instructor on a per project basis. General ideas to keep in mind:

    * References
    * Figures
    * Statistical analysis
    * High-quality visualizations
    * Polished content
    * Clarity and flow
    * Accuracy
    * Time management
    * Questions and Answer


Do note that many of these points will be obtained by answering questions about the project. The code used to generate
work that is presented will be submitted before the project presentation in order to allow the instrtuctor to come up
with compelling questions.


Presentation Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The format of the presentation is up to the individual, but they should be similar to the layout of the reports
(discussed in detail in the following section). For a high-level idea of what to include, see the below list:

    * Intro
    * Project Topic Description
    * Related Works
    * Methodology
    * Results & Discussion
    * Conclusions and Future Work


It is up to the individual to decide how best to communicate their project idea and results. Be sure that the
presentation is not boring. Points may be lost if the presentation does not effectively communicate what was done.



What to Submit to Moodle
========================

.. warning::

    Completing a requirement does not guarantee that the corresponding points will be awarded. Each requirement must be
    completed to the satisfaction of the marker.


* Submit relevant implementations via Moodle by 11:55pm on the due date

    * Include anything the marker may need for effectively evaluating the work
