Course Description
==================

Evolutionary computation is a family of powerful optimization algorithms often used to find solutions to computationally
intractable problems. The study of these algorithms and their application to problems is a large research area within
computer science. Course topics include combinatorial optimization, genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization,
search space analysis, multi-objective optimization, and neuroevolution. Research practices and technical writing will
be emphasized for course assignments/projects.

* Each *point* equals one percent of the final grade
* Individual assignments descriptions will include details on what tasks can be completed
* Although there are 115 points available, the maximum grade that can be obtained is 100% (99% due to system constraints)
* The final project is mandatory to pass

    * If not completed, the final grade will be no more than 45%



Assignments
===========

Breakdown
---------

The majority of the marks will come from applying what was learned in class and independent research in a series of
assignments and projects. Most of these marks will be awarded for sufficiently completing tasks as opposed to a
traditional method of losing marks for mistakes. Details for the breakdown for individual assignments will be included
with the assignment description. To gain a general idea, consider the following example:

    * Implementing an algorithm will award 4 points

        * Adding enhancements to the algorithm may award an additional 3 points
        * Using the algorithm to solve a more complex problem may award an additional 4 points
        * Creating an effective visualization for the algorithm for the problem will award an additional 2 points
        * Writing a report will award up to 4 points

            * Using LaTeX will award an additional 2 points
            * Including proper references/citations awards an additional 2 points
            * Including figures and tables awards an additional 2 points
            * Performing an effective comparison will award an additional 2 points


Certain tasks cannot be completed without first completing a prerequisite task. For example, a report for the assignment
cannot be completed without first implementing the algorithm.

The reports will be marked in a more traditional way (prose, spelling, grammar, effectiveness, etc.)

If any of this description is unclear, please ask the professor for clarification. If you prefer a conventional grading
paradigm with a typical mark breakdown, please see the professor to make arrangements in the first two weeks of the
course.


Submission
----------

Instructions for the submission of assignments will be posted on the course website. It is each student's responsibility
to read and follow the instructions. Failure to follow the submission instructions may result in the assignment
receiving a mark of zero.

You will be required to submit each programming assignment electronically. Details will be given in the assignment
descriptions. Similarity detection software to identify possible cheating cases will be used.


Due Dates
---------

The date and exact time assignments are due will be given in the assignment specifications. No submissions will be taken
after the due date; there are no late submissions. No extensions will be given for assignments.


Marking
-------

Assignments are marked by the Teaching Assistants, who follow marking schemes provided by instructors.

A request for adjustment in an assignment mark must be made within 2 weeks of the date on which it was first available
after marking. (Beyond that date, regrading will not be considered, regardless of whether you retrieved your
assignment). Such a request must be submitted to the course instructor in writing, and must include specific reasons why
you believe you deserve more marks. The request must be accompanied by all materials that were originally handed in, as
well as the original marker's grade summary sheet. The instructor will inform you by email when the reevaluation process
is complete.

It is each student's responsibility to keep up-to-date backups of assignment disk files in case of system crashes or
inadvertently erased files. Students must keep disk copies of all material submitted, as well as the actual graded
assignment, to guard against the possibility of errors in recording marks. It is not safe to discard these materials
until you are satisfied that your final mark for the course has been computed properly.


Project
-------

Each student will complete a final project. The topic and enhancements will be decided on by the student in consultation
with the professor.


Lecture
-------

Each student will complete and present a lecture. The student, in consultation with the professor, will decide on the
topic.



Email Contact
=============

**Email etiquette** --- Emails should be addressed to Dr./Prof. Hughes.

I may need to send email messages to the whole class or to students individually. Email will be sent to the StFX email
address assigned to students. It is the responsibility of the student to read this email on a regular basis. You may
wish to have mail forwarded to an alternative email address.

Note that StFX and most other email providers establish quotas or limits on the amount of space available to you. If you
let your email accumulate there, your mailbox may fill up and you may lose important email from your instructors. Losing
email is not an acceptable excuse for not knowing about the information that was sent.

Students are encouraged to contact their course instructor via email with brief, email appropriate questions regarding
lecture materials or clarification of assignments. However, before sending email to an instructor, the student should
check the course website to see if the requested information is already there. Students must send email from their StFX
account and include CSCI 340 in the subject line of the email. Lengthy and in-depth questions are to be asked during
office hours.



Office Hours
============

Office hours are provided to students to facilitate their success --- students are encouraged to come to office hours.

Students must understand that the professors and TAs are not there to provide them answers to problems, but to assist
students solving their problems.



Attendance
==========

Students missing three classes without reasonable cause will be reported to the Assistant Vice-President Academic
Affairs. See section 3.7 of the academic calendar for more details. You will be reported if you are repeatedly
delinquent in assignments or attendance at classes or laboratories.



Copyright Policy
================

The materials in CSCI 340 at StFX are the property of the instructor, unless stated otherwise by the instructor. Online
posting or selling this material to third parties for distribution without permission is subject to Canadian Copyright
law and is strictly prohibited.

The course copyright policy will be aggressively enforced.



Class Recording Policy
======================

Students may not create audio and/or video recordings of classes. Students creating unauthorized recording of lectures
violate an instructor's intellectual property rights and the Canadian Copyright Act. Students violating this policy will
be subject to disciplinary actions.



Statement of Academic Offenses and Academic Integrity
=====================================================

Please ensure that you are aware of the policy on Academic Integrity. Details can be found
`here <https://www.stfx.ca/media/40111/download>`_.

Scholastic offenses are taken seriously and students are directed to read the appropriate policy, specifically, the
definition of what constitutes a Scholastic Offense. See section 3.8 of the academic calendar.

It is your responsibility to understand what academic misconduct is. Ignorance of the rules is not an admissible excuse
for academic misconduct. I will pursue academic offenses fully. I will apply -100% (not 0) as a grade. I will also
advocate for an automatic failure in the course, or expulsion from the university when allowed.



Use of Plagiarism-Checking Software
-----------------------------------

All required papers/submissions may be subject to submission for textual similarity review to the commercial plagiarism
detection software under license to the University for the detection of plagiarism. All papers submitted for such
checking will be included as source documents in the reference database for the purpose of detecting plagiarism of
papers subsequently submitted to the system.



Use of Cheating-Analysis Software
---------------------------------

All submitted work may be subject to submission for similarity review by software that will check for unusual
coincidences in answer patterns that may indicate cheating (MOSS).



Tutoring
========

The role of tutoring is to help students understand course material. Tutors should not write assignments or take-home
tests for the students who hire them.



Information about Requesting an Accommodation at StFX
