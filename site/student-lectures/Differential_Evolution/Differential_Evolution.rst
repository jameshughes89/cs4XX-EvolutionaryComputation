Introduction to Differential Evolution (DE)
===========================================
* DE is a method in evolutionary computation that optimizes solutions to problem by iteratively improving a candidate solution based on a quality measure.
* It's a type of metaheuristic, making few assumptions about the problem, enabling exploration of large solution spaces.
* DE works well for multidimensional real-valued functions, not requiring differentiability, allowing application to non-continuous, noisy, or time-varying problem.

Algorithm Overview and Mechanics
================================

* DE maintains a population of candidate solutions, creating new ones by combining existing solutions using simple formulae.
* The algorithm operates as a black box, only requiring a measure of quality for candidate solutions.
* It's iterative, with the aim (not guarantee) of discovering a satisfactory solution.

Differential Evolution (DE) is a versatile optimization algorithm known for its simplicity and effectiveness. Here's an overview of its mechanics:

- **Black Box Optimization:** DE is considered a black-box optimizer, meaning it requires only a measure of quality (fitness function) for the candidate solutions. It does not need derivative information or other problem-specific knowledge.

- **Diversity and Convergence:** Achieving a balance between diversity (exploration of the search space) and convergence (exploitation of the best solutions) is a critical aspect of DE. Parameters like the mutation factor and crossover probability play a vital role in maintaining this balance.

- **Adaptability:** DE's mechanics are simple yet powerful, making it adaptable to a wide range of optimization problems. It has been successfully applied in areas such as engineering design, pattern recognition, and machine learning.

- **Stochastic Nature:** Like other evolutionary algorithms, DE is stochastic. This means it employs random processes, though it converges to a solution through deterministic rules based on the fitness of the solutions.



  .. code-block:: text

      create a population of possible solutions
      loop
        for-each possible solution
          pick three random solutions
          combine the three to create a mutation
          combine curr solution with mutation = child
          if child is better than curr solution then
            replace current solution with child
          end-if
        end-for
      end-loop
      return best solution found



Initialization of agents
------------------------

DE starts with the random positioning of agents (candidate solutions) within the search-space:

.. math::

    X_i = X_{\text{min}} + \text{rand}(0,1) \cdot (X_{\text{max}} - X_{\text{min}})

where \( X_i \) represents the position of the \( i^{th} \) agent, \( X_{\text{min}} \) and \( X_{\text{max}} \) are the lower and upper bounds of the search space, respectively.


Mutation in DE
--------------

Mutation involves the generation of a new candidate vector by the weighted difference between two random vectors added to a third vector:

.. math::

    V_i = X_{\text{r1}} + F \cdot (X_{\text{r2}} - X_{\text{r3}})

Here, \( X_{\text{r1}}, X_{\text{r2}}, X_{\text{r3}} \) are three distinct vectors randomly selected from the population, and \( F \) is the mutation factor.


Crossover process
-----------------


During crossover, a trial vector is created by mixing parameters from the mutated vector with those from a target vector:

.. math::

    U_{i,j} = 
    \begin{cases} 
    V_{i,j} & \text{if rand}(j) \leq CR \text{ or } j = \text{rand}(D) \\
    X_{i,j} & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}

  where \( CR \) is the crossover rate, and \( \text{rand}(D) \) ensures that \( U_i \) gets at least one component from \( V_i \).


Selection mechanism
-------------------

The selection mechanism is based on the fitness of the trial vector compared to the target vector:

.. math::

    X_i^{'} = 
    \begin{cases} 
    U_i & \text{if fitness}(U_i) \leq \text{fitness}(X_i) \\
    X_i & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}



Simple Example of Differential evolution
========================================

This section illustrates a basic application of Differential Evolution (DE) to optimize a simple mathematical function, specifically aiming to find the minimum value of a quadratic function \( f(x) = x^2 \).

Initialization
--------------

The process begins with initializing a population of candidate solutions:

.. math::

    P = \{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\}

where \( P \) represents the population, and each \( x_i \) is a randomly chosen value within a predefined range (e.g., -10 to 10).

Mutation
--------

Mutation involves creating a mutant vector for each candidate:

.. math::

    V = a + F \cdot (b - c)

where \( a, b, \), and \( c \) are distinct vectors randomly selected from the population, and \( F \) is a scaling factor (e.g., 0.8).

Crossover
---------

A trial vector is created by mixing elements from the mutant vector and the target vector:

.. math::

    T = \text{crossover}(V, x_i)

This step introduces variability, combining the mutated and target vectors.

Selection
---------

The trial vector is compared with the target vector, and the one with the better fitness value (lower \( f(x) \)) is retained:

.. math::

    x_i^{'} = 
    \begin{cases} 
    T & \text{if } f(T) < f(x_i) \\
    x_i & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}

Repeat
------

The mutation, crossover, and selection steps are repeated for several generations until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum number of generations or a satisfactory error threshold.

In this example, the DE algorithm iteratively adjusts the values of \( x \) in the population to find the one that minimizes \( f(x) = x^2 \). Over generations, the population of \( x \) values should converge towards 0, the point where the function attains its minimum value.



Evolution and Termination
=========================

* **Evolution Process:** 
  - The evolution process in Differential Evolution is a loop consisting of three main steps: mutation, crossover, and selection. Each of these steps plays a crucial role in navigating the search space and converging towards the optimal solution.

* **Termination Criteria:**
  - The termination of the DE algorithm is typically governed by one or more criteria, including:
    * Maximum Number of Generations: A common criterion is to stop the algorithm after a pre-defined number of generations have been completed.
    * Fitness Threshold: The algorithm can also terminate if a solution with a fitness value better than a defined threshold is found.
    * Stagnation: If there is no significant improvement in the population's fitness over a number of generations, the algorithm may terminate, indicating a possible convergence.
    * Resource Limitation: Constraints like computational time or memory usage can also be set as termination conditions.

- **No Guarantee of Finding Global Optimum:**
  - While DE is efficient in exploring the search space, there is no theoretical guarantee that it will find the global optimum, especially in highly complex, multimodal landscapes.

- **Computational Cost in Large-Scale Problems:**
  - For problems with a very large number of variables, the computational cost of DE can become a concern. The algorithm may require a large number of function evaluations to converge, which can be computationally expensive.

- **Balance Between Exploration and Exploitation:**
  - Achieving a balance between exploration (searching new areas of the search space) and exploitation (refining solutions in known good areas) is critical for the success of DE. This balance is hard to maintain and is influenced by parameter settings and the specific problem being solved.

- **Lack of Theoretical Convergence Analysis:**
  - Compared to some other optimization algorithms, DE lacks a comprehensive theoretical analysis of convergence properties. This makes it more of an empirical method, reliant on practical results rather than theoretical guarantees.

* In summary, while DE offers significant advantages in terms of simplicity and effectiveness for a wide range of problems, it also presents challenges related to parameter setting, computational efficiency, and the lack of theoretical guarantees for global optimization. Understanding these aspects is crucial for effectively applying DE to real-world problems.
