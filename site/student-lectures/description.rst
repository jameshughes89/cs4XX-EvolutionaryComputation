Student Lecture Task Description
********************************

* **Maximum Points**: 10
* **Topic Selection Due Date**: October 11, 2023, submitted via email
* **PR Merge Date**: At Least One Day Before the Lecture Date
* **Lecture Date**: November 14th -- 24th



Base Task
=========

Each student must give a 15 -- 20 minute lecture on a topic of their choice. All lectures must be created as a webpage
using *reStructuredText* and Sphinx. Lectures will be submitted as pull requests to the course GitHub repository and all
lectures must be posted to the course website. The lectures will only be posted once approved by the instructor.



Potential Lecture Topics
========================

Below is a list of possible topics, but students may pick other topics as long as they are approved by the instructor.

Only one student may do a lecture on a particular topic. Topics will be selected on a first-come first-served basis. All
topic choices along with preferred lecture date are to be submitted to the instructor via email.


* Differential Evolution **(ALREADY SELECTED)**
* Evolutionary Programming
* Evolutionary Strategies **(ALREADY SELECTED)**
* Ant Colony Optimization **(ALREADY SELECTED)**
* Artificial Immune Systems **(ALREADY SELECTED)**
* Cultural Algorithms **(ALREADY SELECTED)**
* Self Organization
* Artificial Life
* Evolutionary Art **(ALREADY SELECTED)**
* Memetic Algorithms **(ALREADY SELECTED)**
* Search Space Analysis **(ALREADY SELECTED)**
* Coevolution **(ALREADY SELECTED)**
* Neuroevolution
* Fitness Predictors
* Novelty Search **(ALREADY SELECTED)**



Lecture Dates
=============

It may be the case that it is natural for some topics to come before others, but in general, the date will be selected
on a first-come first-served basis. Any students unable to select a date will be assigned one by the instructor.

All topic choices along with preferred lecture date are to be submitted to the instructor via email.

* November 22nd (2 slots available)
* November 24th (0 slots available)



Submitting a Pull Request
=========================

Each lecture will be submitted via a pull request for the course's GitHub repository. The pull request must be approved
by the instructor before it can be added to the course website and ultimately presented.

Pull requests must be merged at least one day before the date of the lecture.

Once the pull request is merged, the GitHub repository will automatically create the webpage with Sphinx and update the
course website with the new content.

The reStructuredText files that are to be submitted via a pull request are to be added under the "student-lecture"
directory within the GitHub repository. Create a sub-directory with an appropriate name for the specific lecture being
created. This sub-directory will contain (a) the reStructuredText (.rst) file along with (b) any related resources such
as images or data files. **Note:** Keep the files small as large files may be rejected.



Provided Files
==============

The course content is written in reStructuredText and the website is generated using Sphinx. Given this, the  GitHub
repository is full of content in reStructuredText that may be used as reference for how to write lectures in this style.



Format
======

Other than using reStructuredText, there is no format for how the lecture should be laid out --- this is up to each
student. Reference the existing course lectures for ideas.



Marking Details
===============

Points will be awarded based on the lecture quality and clarity. Points are awarded for both the content of the lecture
itself along with how the content is delivered.

The key to making a *good* lecture is to ensure that it is not *boring*.
