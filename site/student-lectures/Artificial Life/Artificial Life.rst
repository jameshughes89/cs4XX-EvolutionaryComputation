Artificial Life A-Life
************************
This field combines elements of biology, computer science, and artificial intelligence to explore the behaviors,
survival strategies, and environmental interactions of artificial organisms.

Researchers examine systems to understand real world processes and their evolution.

There are three main streams of artificial life.

    Soft: soft wear.  Involves simulations using computer programs to model life processes.

    Hard: hard wear. Involves creating physical systems that exhibit life-like properties.

    Wet: biochemistry. Involves biochemical processes to create life-like systems in laboratory conditions.

Examples of Artificial Life:

- Game of life
- Sims
- Tamagotchi characters
