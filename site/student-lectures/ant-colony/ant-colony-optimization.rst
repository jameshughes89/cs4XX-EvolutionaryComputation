Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) Lecture
=====================================

Introduction
------------
* Nature has evolved over millions of years, fine-tuning solutions to survival challenges. These solutions, often embedded in the behaviors of organisms, have inspired the creation of algorithms that mimic natural processes.

* To solve complicated problems, nature-inspired algorithms harness the power of evolutionary processes, swarm intelligence, and self-organization.

* These tiny insects, despite their individual simplicity, collectively exhibit remarkable problem-solving capabilities, especially in finding the shortest paths between their nest and food sources.


Ant Colony Behaviour
--------------------
In nature, ants are often tasked with finding the shortest path between their nest and food sources. This process involves a coordinated effort that leverages the following principles:

* **Random Exploration**: Ants initially explore their surroundings randomly, searching for food sources.

* **Pheromone Communication**: As ants discover food, they return to the nest while depositing a chemical substance called pheromone on the ground. This forms a trail that other ants can follow.

* **Positive Feedback**: Shorter paths accumulate pheromones more quickly than longer paths due to the faster travel time. This creates a positive feedback loop where shorter paths attract more ants.

* **Exploitation**: Over time, the pheromone concentration on shorter paths increases, making them more attractive to other ants. This results in a collective focus on the most efficient paths.

* Many algorithms claiming to be "ant colonies" diverge from the standard optimization framework. The commonality lies in utilizing information exchange among ants through the environment, termed "stigmergy." This principle unifies a range of algorithms, with authors coining the term "value" to categorize methods focused on tasks like searching for food and cooperative transportation.


Common extensions
-----------------
* Here are some of the most popular variations of ACO algorithms:
    * Ant system (AS):
    The ant system is the first ACO algorithm. This algorithm corresponds to the one briefly presented later.

    * Elitist ant system:
    In this algorithm, the global best solution deposits pheromone on its trail after every iteration (even if this trail has not been revisited), along with all the other ants. The elitist strategy has as its objective directing the search of all ants to construct a solution to contain links of the current best route.

    * Max-min ant system (MMAS):
    MMAS is designed to address some of the shortcomings of the original ACO algorithm and has proven to be effective for solving combinatorial optimization problems. The Max-Min Ant System aims to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation by limiting the amount of pheromone and emphasizing the role of the best ants in updating pheromone levels. These features contribute to the algorithm's ability to converge to high-quality solutions while preventing premature convergence to suboptimal solutions.

    MMAS has been applied successfully to various combinatorial optimization problems, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), Job Scheduling, and others. It has become a well-known and widely used variant of the original ACO algorithm.

    * Rank-based ant system (ASrank)
    The ASrank (Rank-based Ant System) algorithm involves ranking all solutions based on their lengths. In each iteration, only a predetermined number of the top-performing ants are permitted to update the pheromone trails. The amount of pheromone deposited is adjusted for each solution, giving preference to shorter paths. Consequently, solutions with shorter paths contribute more pheromone than those with longer paths.

    * Parallel ant colony optimization (PACO)
    In traditional ACO, ants construct solutions iteratively in a sequential manner. PACO, on the other hand, introduces parallelism to simultaneously explore multiple solution paths, thereby potentially accelerating the convergence towards high-quality solutions. PACO is particularly useful for solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems, where the solution space is vast and parallel exploration can significantly speed up the search process.


ACO Algorithm Basics
--------------------
* Pseudo code for a simple ACO
.. code-block:: text

    {
    procedure ACO_MetaHeuristic is
        while not terminated do
            generateSolutions()
            daemonActions()
            pheromoneUpdate()
        repeat
    end procedure
    }

* The term "daemon" in this context implies a background process or entity that operates independently to enhance the overall performance of the algorithm.

1. **Problem Definition:**
   - ACO is applied to combinatorial optimization problems where the goal is to find the best combination of elements from a finite set.

2. **Solution Representation:**
   - Solutions are represented as paths or tours through a solution space. Each component of the solution corresponds to a decision variable.

3. **Pheromone Representation:**
   - ACO uses artificial pheromones to model the communication among ants. Pheromones are associated with solution components, and their intensity represents the desirability of that component.

4. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize pheromone levels on all solution components. Typically, initial pheromone levels are set to a constant value.

5. **Ant Movement:**
   - Ants construct solutions by iteratively selecting solution components based on a probabilistic rule that considers both pheromone levels and a heuristic measure.

6. **Solution Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the quality of the solutions constructed by ants.

7. **Pheromone Update:**
   - Update pheromone levels based on the quality of the solutions. Good solutions receive higher pheromone deposits.

8. **Iteration:**
   - Repeat the ant movement, solution evaluation, and pheromone update steps for a specified number of iterations or until a termination criterion is met.

Applications of ACO
-------------------

* Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms have found widespread application in solving diverse combinatorial optimization problems. From quadratic assignment and protein folding to vehicle routing, these algorithms and their derivatives have been adapted for dynamic problems, real variables, stochastic scenarios, multi-targets, and parallel implementations.

\

* ACO offers advantages over approaches like simulated annealing and genetic algorithms, particularly in scenarios where the graph dynamically changes. The continuous adaptability of the ant colony algorithm in real-time makes it well-suited for applications in network routing and urban transportation systems.

    * Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
    * Job Scheduling
    * Vehicle Routing
    * Network Routing

* Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP):

    .. figure:: 1920px-Aco_TSP.svg.png
        :align: center

    1) An ant choose a path among other, and lay a pheromonal trail on it.
    2) All the ants are travelling some paths, laying a trail proportionnal to the quality of the solution.
    3) Each edge of the best path is more reinforced than others.
    4) Evaporation ensures that the bad solutions disappear.
