## This assumes no computer science background

Keep content contributions at an appropriate level for students.

The main learning objectives of this course are:

- Variables
- Types
- I/O
- Functions
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Strings
- Arrays/Lists (linear collection)
- Objects
- A little searching and sorting
- A little complexity analysis
- Very little recursion

Topics out of scope include:

- Linked Structures
- Linear Data Structures
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Lists
- Nonlinear Data Structures
  - Some Trees
- Interfaces
- Inheritance
- Iterators
- Algorithm Analysis
- Recursion
- Searching and Sorting Algorithms

Although no programming language is a learning objective, Python-*isms* are presented where necessary. Additional Python design ideas are welcome, but keep them simple enough to be accessible for the level of student.

## Content Categories

Also keep in mind that there are categories of content

- Topics
  - Asides
- Code

## How to Contribute

### Issues

- Use issues to point out bugs/issues
- Use issues to suggest enhancements
- Use issues to suggest content
- Use issues to suggest changes

### Pull Requests

- Fork and submit PRs to contribute to the repo

### Submitting a Good Issue/Pull Request

- Complete the provided template by leaving the headers filling in the sections
- Communicate effectively
  - If we cannot understand, it will not be addressed
- Use the style guide below
- [Link to any relevant issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
- Not all headers make sense in all cases, remove header where appropriate
  - If you feel it necessary to include the header still, write N/A or Self-Explanatory where appropriate

## Style Guidelines

- Use present tense
  - Good: "Add", "Change", "Update", "Remove"
  - Bad: "Added", "Changing", "Updated", "Removing"
- Keep messages brief, but descriptive
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally
- If appropriate, include Topic# in titles
  - e.g., _Topic4 Add details on ..._
- Feel free to use the following emojis (multiple where applicable):
  - :new: `:new:` New feature, content, files, or request
  - :bomb: `:bomb:` Remove feature, content, or files
  - :mortar_board: `:mortar_board:` Related to course content (topics, code, assignments, etc.)
  - :memo: `:memo:` Documentation related (repo stuff)
  - :robot: `:robot:` Related to deploying the website
  - :lipstick: `:lipstick:` Improving the format/structure/layout of content/files
  - :bug: `:bug:` Bug in Code or Typo
  - :telescope: `:telescope:` Using different words/code for the same ideas
  - :art: `:art:` Relating to figures/images
  - :dancers: `:dancers:` This issue or pull request already exists
  - :medal_sports: `:medal_sports:` Good for newcomers
  - :eyes: `:eyes:` Extra attention is needed
  - :question: `:question:` Further information is requested
